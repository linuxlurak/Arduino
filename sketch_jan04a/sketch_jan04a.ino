Strategy:

Initialize r, g, b to different values
Initialize a loop counter to one.
Begin infinite loop, incrementing counter with every iteration.
Based on a random chance, increment r, g, and b at every iteration
Apply ceiling to r, g, and b.
Using loop counter mod number of pixels to choose a pixel, update one pixel per iteration.
